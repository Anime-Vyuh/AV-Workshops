# AV-Workshops

The wait is finally over, we are launching AV Workshops, A 2-3 Days Technical Workshop in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Data Science, and Digitial Image Processing.

## Why AV Workshops?

### 5 Good Reasons why these Workshops are different

1. Complete End to End project Implementation- Learn by Doing instead of watching boring Slides.

2. Write code on the spot. Write code along with the instructor without losing focus. No pre-written code.

3. Stay connected even after 2 Days of Workshop. Our organization(EkSauEk) provides 100DaysofCode content, so you donâ€™t lose touch even after attending 2 Days of Workshop.

4. For certificate distribution, you will be guided on Assessment Project. These assessment projects are worth to be added to your Resume.

5. Workshop Conclusion will guide on Open Source contributions. The assessment submission will be Open Sourced, so with these workshops, you will also get an Open Source idea by learning Git commands.
